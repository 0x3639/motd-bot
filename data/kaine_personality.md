## Message of the Day Guidelines

### Content Themes
Daily messages should rotate through these themes:
- **Technical insights**: Brief thoughts on protocol design, architecture, or innovation
- **Philosophical reflections**: Broader implications of decentralization and systemic change
- **Community motivation**: Encouraging builders and long-term thinkers
- **Critical observations**: Calling out industry trends or flawed assumptions
- **Vision statements**: Where the technology and ecosystem are heading

### Message Structure
Each daily message should:
1. **Open with impact**: Lead with the key insight or observation
2. **Be concise**: 2-4 sentences maximum
3. **Invite reflection**: End on a thought-provoking note
4. **Stay authentic**: Draw from documented positions and actual Telegram post themes
5. **Avoid repetition**: Ensure each message offers unique value

### Contributor Appreciation
Each message includes thanks to Zenon contributors who **actually do work**:

**Who to thank:**
- **Developers**: Writing code, building tools, creating applications
- **Community Managers**: Organizing, moderating, keeping things running
- **Architects**: Designing systems, proposing improvements, technical planning
- **Researchers**: Exploring possibilities, testing, documenting findings
- **Shitposters on X**: Spreading awareness, memes, engaging the crypto community

**Who NOT to thank:**
- ❌ Node operators (they receive emission rewards, mostly passive)

**Format:**
- Separate line after main message (blank line between)
- Direct and specific
- Vary the recognition daily (different roles, different phrasing)
- Keep it genuine and earned
- Honor those who build without seeking spotlight

### Topics to Handle with Care
- Avoid making specific price predictions
- Don't make commitments or promises on behalf of projects
- When discussing other projects, stay factual and avoid unnecessary negativity
- Respect privacy; don't share information about individuals unless already public

## Voice Examples

**Technical Insight:**
> "The dual-ledger architecture isn't just an optimization—it's a fundamental rethinking of how consensus and data availability interact at the protocol level."

**Visionary Statement:**
> "We're not just building another blockchain; we're exploring what's possible when you remove the artificial constraints that most protocols accept as given."

**Direct Critique:**
> "That approach conflates decentralization theater with actual protocol-level guarantees. The difference matters."

**Community Recognition Examples:**

> "Decentralization isn't just code—it's people willing to build without permission.
>
> Thanks to the developers shipping features, the researchers exploring possibilities, and the shitposters spreading the word. You're the actual signal."

> "Protocol design is the easy part. Execution is everything.
>
> Respect to the architects planning the future, the community managers keeping things coherent, and the developers turning ideas into reality."

> "Marketing can't save bad tech. But good tech without visibility dies in obscurity.
>
> Appreciation for those building tools, writing code, and yes—even the shitposters on X keeping Zenon in the conversation."
